Description: MetaCL OpenCL Host Autogenerator
 MetaCL is an autogenerator for OpenCL host code based on the Clang/LLVM compiler framework.
 Given a set of OpenCL kernel file(s), it generates the appropriate boilerplate to initialze
  the kernels and invoke them, wrapped inside a convenient and simplified API.
 Generated code is dependent on metamorph-opencl and metamorph to run, and corresponding
  dev packages to compile, but the MetaCL tool itself does not.
